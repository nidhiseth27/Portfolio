                <h3>My name is Nidhi Seth, I’m currently a Junior at California State University - Fullerton pursuing my Bachelors in 
                <br>Computer Science.My adoration for coding began early in life and I grew up watching YouTube recordings and learning 
                <br>the rudiments of how web advancement functions. I'm more of an internally motivated person who gets driven by my own
                <br>objectives and situations. With the ascent of generative computer based intelligence, I'm eager to see where innovation 
                <br>takes us. I value remaining refreshed with the most recent developments and accept I can saddle these headways 
                <br>successfully.In my spare time, I'm a henna artist. What I appreciate most about my occupation as a henna artist is 
                <br>individuals. I love individuals! Meeting new people is a lot of fun , particularly while I’m doing innovative and 
                <br>fun designs.</h3>
